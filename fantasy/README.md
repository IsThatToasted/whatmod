# Afterglow - Global Notifications Build

Upload the contents of this zip directly into `/fantasy/`.

Adds a global in-app notification service:
- New chat/private photo popups appear anywhere in the app, not only inside a thread.
- Chat and Matches nav badges update globally.
- Incoming likes can notify from any screen.
- Opening a chat clears that conversation's unread badge.

No database changes required from the previous build.


## Intimacy Patch

Added in this build:
- Mood picker on the profile page.
- Weekly Glow Goals with coin rewards.
- Private profile albums.
- Blurred private album previews on matched profiles.
- Album access requests sent through the message thread.
- Accept/Deny buttons for album owners inside chat.

Run `supabase-schema.sql` again before testing the private album features.
